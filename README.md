## [Exploring Correlated Photons](https://github.com/jacobsc050/quantum-mechanics)



### Project Summary

This project used Mark Beck's Quantum Mechanics: Theory and Experiemnt. I explored correlated photons along with leading a team of three undergraduate students in performing these expriments.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to join research that has been going on for almost a decade and further it, specify equipment that is needed then purchasing said equipment, and work with other scientists to conduct research. 

## [Senior Thesis](https://github.com/jacobsc050/senior-thesis)

### Project Summary

This project used an integration sphere, psoc, and python. I explored the effects of wavelength of ambient photons on avalanche currents of a reverse biased diode.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to design an experiment, mentor students, and write scientific papers.  


## [Temperature Controller with an Arduino](https://github.com/jacobsc050/temperature-controller-arduino)

### Project Summary

This project used an arduino and thermistor to control the temperature of an immersion water heater.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to integrate hardware and software to complete a goal, calibrate devices through collecting and analyzing data, and use of mathematics in a real world setting.  

## [Portfolio](https://jacobsc050.github.io/portfolio/)

### Project Summary

This project used Bootstrap to build a website for me to show employeers smaller examples of my work in web development, data science, and computational physics.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to using HTML, CSS and I can span several different fields (physics, mathematics, web development, data sceince) efficiently.


## [Presentations and Pedagogy](https://github.com/jacobsc050/presentations-and-pedagogy)

### Project Summary

This project includes scentific presentations and examples of pedagogy skills.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to communicate science, produce imagary to assist in explanations and producing worksheets to assist students in learning.
