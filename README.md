### Project Summary

This project used Bootstrap to build a place for me to show those my works.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to using HTML, CSS and I can span serval different fields (physics, mathematics, web development, data sceince) efficiently.


## [Exploring the Quantum Nature of Light](https://github.com/jacobsc050/quantum-mechanics)



### Project Summary

Using Mark Beck's Quantum Mechanics: Theory and Experiemnt I explored the quantum nature of light along with mentoring three undergraduate students in the scientific method.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability join research that has been going on for almost a decade and furthering it, specifying equipment needs then purchasing said equipment that allowed me to build apparatuses necessary to conduct experiments, and working with professsors and undergraduates to conduct science. 

## [Wavelength of Light and Avalanche Currents](https://github.com/jacobsc050/senior-thesis)

### Project Summary

Using an arduino, thermistor, and imersion water heater I explored keeping the temperature of water constant.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to design an experiment, mentor students, and write scientific papers.  


## [Temperature Controller with an Arduino](https://github.com/jacobsc050/temperature-controller-arduino)

### Project Summary

Using an arduino, thermistor, and imersion water heater I explored keeping the temperature of water constant.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to integrate hardware and software to complete a goal, calibrate devices through collecting and analyzing data, and use mathematics in a real world setting.  


## [Presentations and Pedagogy](https://github.com/jacobsc050/presentations-and-pedagogy)

### Project Summary

As a student I have given many scentific presentations and have spent significant time thinking about pedagoy skills. This project shows off some of my work in this regard.

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to communicate science, produce imagary to assist in explanations and producing worksheets to assist students in learning.
